# Human-Activity-Recognition

Approaches Used: LDA, Multinomial Logistic Regression, SVM and K Nearest Neighbours 
Technologies Used: Python

1) The goal is to understand in detail about the working of the various classifiers on Human Activity Recognition Dataset. 

2) The source data is obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). 

3) The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within age brackets 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (SITTING, STANDING, LYING, WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS). The six activities as six classes corresponds to each data point with 561 features. 

4) The Approaches used are: Linear Discriminant Analyses (LDA); Multinomial Logistic Regression; Support Vector Machines (SVM) and kNN. 

5) The comparison is performed based on the confusion matrix of those classification results on the test data using the different training classifiers, presented by confusion matrices. 

6) SVM with linear kernel approach is the best fit classifier to our dataset. It gives the best performance for all the accuracies and error rates. SVM with linear kernel being a flexible approach which is capable to reduce overfitting.
