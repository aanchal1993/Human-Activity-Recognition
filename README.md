# Human-Activity-Recognition

Approaches Used: LDA, Multinomial Logistic Regression, SVM and K Nearest Neighbours 
Technologies Used: python

Led the implementation of thie project to understand in detail the working of the various classifiers.
Group of 30 volunteers participated in the activities wearing accelerometer and gyroscope. 
Each person performed 6 activities: SITTING, STANDING, LAYING, WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS 
SVM with linear kernel provides a much more accuracy than all the other classifiers used 
Most of the errors are due to similar reading from the sensors for the ‘sitting’ and ‘standing’ activity.
